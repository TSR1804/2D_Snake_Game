# 2D_Snake_Game
Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the player until it either collides with the border or its own body.

Food: Food items are randomly generated on the plane. When the snake's head collides with a food item, the snake consumes it, and its length increases by one unit.

Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the snake and the walls of the bordered plane or between different segments of the snake's body. A collision ends the game.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food. The score may be displayed on the screen for the player to see their progress.
